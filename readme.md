# Learning TypeScript

- TypeScript ensures type safety
- Interview Question: How do we define integers or floats in typescript?
  Hint: We don't need to define, integers and float everything is just number
- It is redundent to write the type when declaring a number, because typescript is smart enough to detecht it and automatically asinged the type as number
